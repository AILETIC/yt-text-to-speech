# Installing Text-to-Speech Model

This guide will walk you through the installation process for running a text-to-speech model on your local machine. We will be using a Python library called TTS, which provides better audio quality compared to other text-to-speech models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

## Installation Steps

### Windows

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Clone the repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

3. Change to the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd repository
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

6. Upgrade pip:
   ```
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

7. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. Run the text-to-speech generation script:
   ```
   python better.py
   ```

### Mac/Linux

1. Open a terminal.

2. Clone the repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

3. Change to the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd repository
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

6. Upgrade pip:
   ```
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

7. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. Run the text-to-speech generation script:
   ```
   python3 better.py
   ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should now have the text-to-speech model installed and running on your local machine. You can experiment with different models by checking the available models in the code and selecting the one you prefer. Enjoy generating more human-like voices!
